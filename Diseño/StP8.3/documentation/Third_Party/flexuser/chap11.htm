  <a name="916062"> </a>Frequently Asked Questions
</h2><hr>


<h3>
  <a name="896520"> </a>D.1	 License File Questions
</h3>


<h4>
  <a name="896524"> </a>D.1.1	 I've received FLEX<em>lm</em> license files from two different companies. Do I have to combine them? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896525"> </a>You don't have to combine license files. Each license file that has any counted lines (the license count field is &gt; 0) requires a server. It's perfectly OK to have any number of separate license files, with different <code>lmgrd</code> server processes supporting each file. Moreover, since <code>lmgrd</code> is a lightweight process, for sites without system administrators, this is often the simplest (and therefore recommended) way to proceed. With v6.0+ <code>lmgrd</code>/<code>lmdown</code>/<code>lmreread</code>, you can restart/stop/reread a single vendor daemon (of any FLEX<em>lm</em> version). This makes combining licenses more attractive than previously. Also, if the application is v6.0+, using <code><em>dir</em></code><code>/*.lic</code> for license file management behaves like combining licenses without physically combining them.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896530"> </a>D.1.2	 When is it recommended to combine license files?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896531"> </a>Many system administrators, especially for larger sites, prefer to combine license files to ease administration of FLEX<em>lm</em> licenses. It's purely a matter of preference. 
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896539"> </a>D.1.3	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> handle dates in the year 2000 and beyond?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896543"> </a>Yes. The FLEX<em>lm</em> date format uses a four-digit year. Dates in the 20th century (19xx) can be abbreviated to the last two digits of the year (xx), and use of this feature is quite widespread. Dates in the year 2000 and beyond must specify all four year digits. 
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="896547"> </a>D.2	 FLEX<em>lm</em> Versions
</h3>


<h4>
  <a name="896551"> </a>D.2.1	 I have products from several companies at various FLEX<em>lm</em> version levels. Do I have to worry about how these versions work together? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896552"> </a>If you're not combining license files from different vendors, the simplest thing to do is make sure you use the tools that are shipped by each vendor. 
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896553"> </a><code>lmgrd</code> will always correctly support older versions of vendor daemons and applications, so it's <font  face="Times New Roman" size="2">always</font> safe to use the latest version of <code>lmgrd</code> and the <code>lmutil</code>/LMTOOLS utilities. If you've combined license files from two vendors, you<em> must </em>use the latest version of <code>lmgrd</code>.
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896554"> </a>If you've received two versions of a product from the same vendor, you <em>must</em> use the latest vendor daemon they send you. An older vendor daemon with a newer client will cause communication errors.
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896558"> </a>Please ignore letters appended to FLEX<em>lm</em> versions, for example, the "d" in v2.4d. The appended letter indicates a patch, and does NOT indicate any compatibility differences. In particular, some elements of FLEX<em>lm</em> didn't require certain patches, so a v2.4 <code>lmgrd</code> will work successfully with a v2.4b vendor daemon. See also <a href="chap15.htm#916243">Section H.1, "Version Compatibility and Components."</a>
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896565"> </a>D.2.2	 I've received a new copy of a product from a vendor, and it uses a new version of FLEX<em>lm</em>. Is my old license file still valid?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896572"> </a>Yes. Older FLEX<em>lm</em> license files are always valid with newer versions of FLEX<em>lm</em>. 
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896576"> </a>D.2.3	 I've received a new license file, and the format is different from the old one I had from the same vendor? Why? Are they compatible?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896583"> </a>As of v3.0, FLEX<em>lm</em> has an optional new format for license files. FLEX<em>lm</em> products always understand older versions; therefore, the pre-v3.0 files are understood by every FLEX<em>lm</em> version. However, your old applications (pre-FLEX<em>lm</em> v3.0) will not be able to use the new license file. See also <a href="chap2.htm#893241">Section 2.2, "License File Format."</a>
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="896596"> </a>D.3	 Using FLEX<em>lm</em>
</h3>


<h4>
  <a name="896601"> </a>D.3.1	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> work across the Internet?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896602"> </a>Yes. A server on the Internet will serve licenses to anyone else on the Internet. This can be limited with the INTERNET= attribute on the FEATURE line, which limits access to a range of Internet addresses. You can also use the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE options in the daemon option file to allow (or deny) access to clients running on a range of Internet addresses.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896607"> </a>D.3.2	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> work with Internet firewalls?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896611"> </a>Many firewalls require that port numbers be specified to the firewall. FLEX<em>lm</em> v5 <code>lmgrd</code> supports this.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896612"> </a>D.3.3	 If my client dies, does the server free the license? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896613"> </a>Yes, unless the client's whole system crashes, or becomes disconnected from the network. Assuming communications is TCP, the license is automatically freed immediately. If communications are UDP, then the license is freed after the UDP timeout, which is set by each vendor, but defaults to 45 minutes. UDP communications is normally only set by the end user, so TCP should be assumed. If the whole system crashes, then the license is not freed, and you should use <code>lmremove</code> to free the license.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896614"> </a>D.3.4	 What happens when the license server dies? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896618"> </a>FLEX<em>lm</em> applications send periodic heartbeats to the server to discover if it has died. What happens when the server dies is then up to the application. Some will simply continue periodically attempting to re-checkout the license when the server comes back up. Some will attempt to re-checkout a license a few times, and then, presumably with some warning, exit. Some GUI applications will present pop-ups to the user periodically letting them know the server is down and needs to be restarted. 
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896619"> </a>D.3.5	 How do you tell if a port is already in use? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896621"> </a>99.44% of the time, if it's in use, it's because <code>lmgrd</code> is already running on the port-or was recently killed, and the port isn't freed yet. Assuming this is not the case, then use <code>telnet </code><code><em>host</em></code><code> </code><code><em>port</em></code>- if it says "Can't connect," it's a free port. 
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896625"> </a>D.3.6	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> require root permissions?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896630"> </a>No. There is no part of FLEX<em>lm</em>, <code>lmgrd</code>, vendor daemon, or application, that requires root permissions. In fact, it is <font  face="Times New Roman" size="2">strongly recommended</font> that you do not run the license server (<code>lmgrd</code>) as "root," since root processes can introduce security risks. If <code>lmgrd</code> must be started from the root user (for example, in a system boot script), it is recommended that you use the <code>su</code> command to run <code>lmgrd</code> as a non-privileged user:
</p>

<dl>
  <dl>
     <dt> <a name="896631"> </a><CODE>su <code><em>username</em></code> -c "<code><em>lmgrd_path</em></code> -c <code><em>license_file_path</em></code> -l <code><em>debug_log_path</em></code>"</CODE>
  </dl>
</dl>

<p>
  <a name="896632"> </a>where <code><em>username</em></code> is a non-privileged user, and the paths are the correct paths to <code>lmgrd</code>, the license file, and the debug log file. You will have to ensure that the vendor daemons listed in the license file have execute permissions for <code><em>username</em></code>. The paths to all the vendor daemons in the license file are listed on each DAEMON line.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896635"> </a>D.3.7	 Is it OK to run lmgrd as "root" (UNIX only)?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896636"> </a>It is not prudent to run any command, particularly a daemon, as root on UNIX, as it may pose a security risk to the operating system. Therefore, it is recommended that <code>lmgrd</code> be run as a non-privileged user (not "root"). For examle, if you are starting <code>lmgrd</code> from a boot script, use: 
</p>

<dl>
  <dl>
     <dt> <a name="896637"> </a><CODE>su <code><em>username</em></code> -c "umask 022; lmgrd..."</CODE>
  </dl>
</dl>

<p>
  <a name="896638"> </a>to run <code>lmgrd</code> as a non-privileged user.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896643"> </a>D.3.8	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em><font  face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font>licensing impose a heavy load on the network? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896644"> </a>No, but partly this depends on the application, and end user's use. A typical checkout request requires five messages and responses between client and server, and each message is &lt;150 bytes. 
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896645"> </a>When a server is not receiving requests, it requires virtually no CPU time. 
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896646"> </a>When an application, or <code>lmstat</code>, requests the list of current users, this can significantly increase the amount of networking FLEX<em>lm</em> uses, depending on the number of current users. 
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896653"> </a>Also, prior to FLEX<em>lm</em> v5, use of <code><em>port</em></code><code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code> can increase network load, since the license file is downloaded from the server to the client. <code><em>port</em></code><code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code> should be, if possible, limited to small license files (say, &lt;50 features). In v5, <code><em>port</em></code><code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code> actually <font  face="Times New Roman" size="2">improves</font> performance.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896658"> </a>D.3.9	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> work with NFS?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896665"> </a>Yes. FLEX<em>lm</em> has no direct interaction with NFS. FLEX<em>lm</em> uses an NFS-mounted file like any other application. 
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896671"> </a>D.3.10	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> work with ATM, ISDN, Token-Ring, etc.
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896678"> </a>In general, these have no impact on FLEX<em>lm</em>. FLEX<em>lm</em> requires TCP/IP. So long as TCP/IP works, FLEX<em>lm</em> will work.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896686"> </a>D.3.11	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> work with subnets, fully qualified names, multiple domains, etc.?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896688"> </a>Yes, although this behavior was improved in v3.0, and v6.0.
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896689"> </a>When a license server and a client are located in different domains, fully qualified host names have to be used. A "fully qualified host name" is of the form <code><em>node</em></code><code>.</code><code><em>domain</em></code>, where <code><em>node</em></code> is the local host name (usually returned by the <code>hostname</code> command or <code>uname -n</code>) and <code><em>domain</em></code> is the Internet domain name, e.g., "globes.com."
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896693"> </a>To ensure success with FLEX<em>lm</em> across domains, do the following: 
</p>

<ol type="1">


  <li  value="1"><a name="896694"> </a>Make the sure the fully qualified host name is the name on the SERVER line of the license file. 
  <li  value="2"><a name="896695"> </a>Make sure ALL client nodes, as well as the server node, are able to <code>telnet</code> to that fully qualified host name. For example, if the host is locally called "speedy," and the domain name is "corp.com," local systems will be able to logon to "speedy" via <code>telnet speedy</code>. But very often, <code>telnet speedy.corp.com</code> will fail locally. Note that this <code>telnet</code> command will always succeed on hosts in other domains (assuming everything is configured correctly), since the network will resolve "speedy.corp.com" automatically. 
  <li  value="3"><a name="896696"> </a>Finally, there must be an alias for "speedy" so it's also known locally as "speedy.corp.com." This alias is added to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, or if NIS/Yellow Pages are being used, then it will have to be added to the NIS database. This requirement goes away in version 3.0 of FLEX<em>lm</em>.
</ol>

<p>
  <a name="896701"> </a>If all components (application, <code>lmgrd</code> and vendor daemon) are v6.0 or higher, no aliases are required; the only requirement is that the fully qualified domain name, or IP address, is used as a host name on the SERVER, or as a host name in the <code>LM_LICENSE_FILE</code> environment variable (<code><em>port</em></code><code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code> or <code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code>).
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896710"> </a>D.3.12	 Does FLEX<em>lm</em> work with NIS and DNS?
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896714"> </a>Yes. However, some sites have broken NIS or DNS, which will cause FLEX<em>lm</em> to fail. In v5 of FLEX<em>lm</em>, NIS and DNS can be avoided to solve this problem. In particular, sometimes DNS is configured for a server that's not current available (e.g., a dial-up connection from a PC). Again, if DNS is configured, but the server is not available, FLEX<em>lm</em> will fail.
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896721"> </a>On PCs, if a checkout seems to take three minutes and then fails, this is usually because the system is configured for a dial-up DNS server which is not currently available. The solution here is to turn off DNS.
</p>


<p>
  <a name="896722"> </a>Finally, host names must NOT have periods in the name. These are not legal host names, although PCs will allow you to enter them, and they will not work with DNS.
</p>


<h4>
  <a name="896727"> </a>D.3.13	 We are using FLEX<em>lm</em> over a wide-area network. What can we do to improve performance? 
</h4>


<p>
  <a name="896731"> </a>FLEX<em>lm</em> network traffic should be minimized. With the most common uses of FLEX<em>lm</em>, traffic is negligible. In particular, checkout, checkin, and heartbeats use very little networking traffic. There are two items, however, which can send considerably more data and should be avoided or used sparingly:
</p>

<ul>


  <li ><a name="896735"> </a><code>lmstat -a</code> should be used sparingly. <code>lmstat -a</code> should not be used more than, say, once every 15 minutes, and should be particularly avoided when there's a lot of features, or concurrent users, and therefore a lot of data to transmit; say, more than 20 concurrent users or features. 
  <li ><a name="896742"> </a>Prior to FLEX<em>lm</em> v5, the <code><em>port</em></code><code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code> mode of the <code>LM_LICENSE_FILE</code> environment variable should be avoided, especially when the license file has many features, or there are a lot of license files included in <code>LM_LICENSE_FILE</code>. The license file information is sent via the network, and can place a heavy load. Failures due to <code><em>port</em></code><code>@</code><code><em>host</em></code> will generate the error <code>LM_SERVNOREADLIC (-61)</code>. 
</ul>
