% The end is defined by a line starting with ESC (\033)
5000;\  Left button - select a rectangular region of cells as command operand
5001;Middle button - undo last command
5002;\ Right button - pop up a command menu and select new command
5003;\n
5004;The editor window is partitioned into 4 subwindows. The current command
5005;area, a message subwindow, a control panel subwindow and the paint area.
5006;\n
5007;The current command is shown in the top left corner and may be repeated
5008;until a new command is chosen.
5009;\n
5010;In the control panel subwindow area, the "button" commands are activated
5011;by pointing at the button label and clicking the left mouse button.
5012;To change the value of the items which require text input, point
5013;at the item label, click the left button, and begin typing. Your
5014;normal editing characters (character, word, line delete) are valid.
5015;To load a new table type, you can select the "Load" button and then
5016;select the new type from the pop-up menu which will subsequently be
5017;displayed or you may select an item from the pull down menu that is
5018;displayed by clicking the right mouse button on the "Table Type" item.
5019;Click the left button on an item in the control panel to get more help
5020;(or type a carriage return in a text item).
5021;\n
5022;Table editing is done in the large paint window. In general, editing
5023;is done by selecting a command from the pop up menu and then selecting
5024;operands for this command. For example, if you wanted to move a block of
5025;cells from one location to another, you would first select the "move"
5026;command from the pop up menu by pressing the right mouse button in the
5027;editing area, and then releasing the button while the cursor is over the
5028;"move" item. Then you would need to select the source and destination
5029;operands for this command. In general, a command operand is selected by
5030;pressing the left mouse button in the upper left hand cell of the
5031;desired block of cells, and holding the button down until you drag the
5032;mouse to the lower left hand cell in the desired block of cells.
5033;So to move a block of cells you would need to first select the block of
5034;cells to be moved and then select the new block of cells that they should
5035;be moved to.
5036;To label a block of cells, select the "insert" command, select the block
5037;cells and begin typing. A cell label is terminated either by hitting the
5038;ESCAPE key or clicking a mouse button.
5039;\n
5040;To get more help on commands in the pop up menu, select the item
5041;from the menu.
5042;\n
5043;To terminate the help mode, click the left mouse button in the editing
5044;area
