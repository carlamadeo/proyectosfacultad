<P>In an heterogeneous environment, such as networks, a need of connection 
devices which would inter-connect two different technologies is essential. In 
this environment the router is that device. <BR>As it's name implies, the router 
also serves as a routing switch-board.&nbsp; Routers connect two or more 
networks and forward data packets between them.&nbsp; When data arrives from one 
of the segments, the router decides, according to it's routing table, to which 
segment to forward that data. <BR>Even though each of the routers' connections 
is to one physical network, that one network could connect to other networks 
through the use of other routers.&nbsp; This way, many networks can 
interconnect.&nbsp; To understand how routing occurs in such networks, we'll 
refer to the following diagram: <BR>&nbsp;

width=530></CENTER>
<P>In the above configuration, router B's table would say, for instance, that 
data going to network 4 should go to router C.&nbsp; Packets going from network 
1 to network 4 would go through router B into network 2 and so on, till they 
reache their destination. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>We would like to emphesize that routers "know" only about networks, and not 
about hosts.&nbsp; In IP networks, routers utilize the fact that each host's IP 
address contains two parts: the host's network address, and the host's number on 
that network.&nbsp; Routers examine the data destination address, extract, from 
it, the target network address, and decide, based on this network address, where 
to transfer the data. 
<P>A router is actually a special computer which is dedicated to the task of 
interconnecting networks.&nbsp; It moves information from its source to its 
destination regardless of the middleware. 
<P>Note: A router resembles a bridge (they both have conventional processor, 
memory and few different I/O interfaces, each for another network it connects), 
but while bridging occurs at the link layer, routing occurs at the network layer 
(see: <A 
href="http://www.rad.com/networks/1997/nettut/protocols.html">protocols</A>). 
This difference provides information to the router that the bridge doesn't have 
access to.

responsibilities</FONT></FONT></I></B> 
<P>Routers have two major responsibilities 
<OL>
  <LI>Optimizing the routing paths. <BR>A router uses a routing algorithm to 
  determine the optimal path to the destination. These algorithms maintain 
  routing tables which contain route information such as destination/next hop 
  association. Routing algorithms has several goals: 
  <UL>
    <LI><U>Optimality</U> - finding the "best" route depending on the metric 
    weightings used by the specific router (there are several metrics used by 
    routers, each assigns different weights to routing algorithm's parameters 
    such as number of hops, delay) 
    <LI><U>Simplicity and low overhead</U> - router algorithms must be as 
    efficient as possible with minimum utilization overhead.&nbsp; An efficient 
    algorithm is particularly important when using routing software on a limited 
    resources computer. 
    <LI><U>Robustness and stability </U>- routers are located at network 
    junction points, therefore they must be robust with the ability to handle 
    unusual behavior of hardware and software components. 
    <LI><U>Rapid convergence</U> - routers must agree on the optimal paths over 
    the net in order to avoid loops.&nbsp; When a network event (computer/router 
    failure, network segment going down etc..)&nbsp; force changes in the 
    router's routing tables, each router must perform recalculations based on 
    the update messages it received from other routers on the net. 
    <LI><U>Flexibility</U> - is the ability to adapt accurately and quickly to 
    network changes and events. For example when the optimal routes are no 
    longer accessible or even optimal, due to some change in the network 
    (segments going down, change in bandwidth, router queue size, network delay, 
    and other variables), the routing algorithms should quickly adjust to the 
    new situation and choose the next best route to replace the old ones which 
    are not accessible any more. </LI></UL>&nbsp; 
  <LI>Switching - transport of packets over networks. <BR>When computer wants to 
  send a packet over the net, it formats a packet with the router's physical 
  address and the destination address (protocol address) of the target 
  host.&nbsp; The router searches it's routing tables for the destination host. 
  If there is no entry for the destination host the router usually drops the 
  packet, otherwise (there is an entry for the destination host) it replaces the 
  physical address with the next hop's address and retransmits the packet. 
  <BR>The next hop isn't&nbsp; necessarily the ultimate destination host, it may 
  be another router which performs the same routine again. A packet may "visit" 
  few routers / hosts on its route, each time it's destination physical address 
  changes. <BR>&nbsp;</LI></OL><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT
