<P>A common problem in the networking world is that of weakening electical 
signals.&nbsp; Electrical signals traveling through wires (such as copper wires 
used in most networks), weaken due to the wire's electircal resistance.&nbsp; 
This effect limits the lengths of the cable that can be used.&nbsp; A repeater 
will overcome this limit, when there is a need to connect two computers at a 
larger distance. <BR>A repeater is connected to two cable segments.&nbsp; Any 
electrical signal reaching the repeater from one segment, will be amplified and 
retransmitted to the other segment.

<P>The amount of repeaters that can be chained together is limited.&nbsp; This 
is because most network types assume a maximum segment length and propogation 
time.&nbsp; For instance, each Ethernet network type imposes a maximum time 
limit for each electrical signal to reach the entire network.&nbsp; Using 
repeaters slows the signal's propogation, and thus the amout of repeaters should 
be limited. 
<P>The upside of repeaters is that they are very simple to manufacture and 
therefore cheap.<BR><BR><BR>The downside of repeaters, which are dumb electrical 
devices, is that they do not "understand" the nature of the electrical signals 
they are amplifying.&nbsp; Repeater may encounter 3 types of electrical input 
signals which represent: 
<OL>
  <LI>Proparly formatted data that should be repeated to the repeater's other 
  segment. (i.e. when the data's target is on the repeater's other segment) 
  <LI>Proparly formatted data that should not be repeated to the repeater's 
  other segment. (i.e. when the data's target is not on the repeater's other 
  segment) 
  <LI>Improparly formatted data or noise that, of course, should not be 
  repeated. </LI></OL>The repeater will repeat (retransmit) all 3 types of signals 
while it should only repeat the first one. This, needlessly, increases network 
traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>
