#  Communicates Container Specification
#
#  This file defines what Communicates information is processed,
#  how it is processed, and the order it is processed.
#
#  This file may be specified as the starting Specification or referenced by
#  another Specification.
#
#  This file may be modified by the user.
#
#  NOTE=    The preferred approach is for the user to copy this file
#           into their workspace.  The copy of this file can then be
#           modified as desired.

#  The following lines specify the Communicates Container format.

#  Directives for the Communicates Specification are as follows=
#
#  The text in a Specification must comply with the following rules=
#	1.	Comment lines begin with a pound sign (i.e., #)
#	2.	All other lines must have at least (2) fields and no more
#		than four (4).  The fields are separated by an equals sign (=)
#		and described as follows=
#  		<directive>=<value>=<unused>=<description>
#	3.	The Directives are specific to a type of Specification where
#		the Specification type is defined with the 'Type' Directive.
#	4.	The 'Type' Directive must exist and be a valid Method Type.
#	5.	Directives values are dependent on the Directive.
#		They may be blank, enumerated, filenames, lists, numeric,
#		strings, subfields, or text.
#	5.a	Blank values have no value.
#	5.b	Enumerated values have values specific to the Directive
#		(see the Directive below).
#	5.c	Filenames reference other Specifications.  They must be the
#		complete path to the Specification.
#		Environment variables may be used within the file specification.
#		The file must exist or an error will be issued.
#	5.d	List values are a series of names separated by spaces.
#	5.e	The numeric values must be Integer or Real numbers.
#	5.f	Strings usually refer to specific values such as the name of a
#		Property.
#	5.g	A Subfield value has sub-records.  The sub-records are
#		separated semi-colons (;).  The sub-records have sub-fields.
#		The sub-fields are separated by colons (=).  Thus, a subfield
#		syntax is as follows=
#		<sub-directive>=<sub-value>;<sub-directive>=<sub-value>;...
#	5.h	A text value is any alpha-numeric characters.  It may contain
#		variables.
#	5.h.1	Valid variables are specified in the VARIABLES section below.  
#	5.h.2	In addition, the Section Directive may contain the
#		following variables=
#			$INCREMENT - increment the section's level.
#			$DECREMENT - decrement the section's level.
