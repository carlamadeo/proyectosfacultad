#  Note Table Specification
#
#  This file defines what Note information is processed, how it is processed,
#  and the order it is processed.  This file may be specified as the starting
#  Specification or referenced by another Specification.
#
#  This file may be modified by the user.
#
#  NOTE=  	The preferred approach is for the user to copy this file into
#		their workspace.  The copy of this file can then be modified
#		as desired.  
#
#
#  The following lines specify the Note format
#  A description of the Specification follows its specification.  
#

Type= Note
NAME=TestDataItem
Item=TDataItemName
Item=TDataTypeName


#  The text in the Specification must comply with the following rules=
#	1.	Comment lines begin with a pound sign (i.e., #)
#	2.	All other lines must have two (2) fields and may have as many
#		as (4) fields where fields are separated by an equal sign (i.e., =).  
#		The fields are described as follows=
#  		<directive>=<directive value>=<valid directive values>=<description>
#	3.	The directives are specific to a type of Specification where the
#		Specification type is defined with the "Type" directive.
#	4.	The "Type" directive must exist and have a valid value.
#	5.	Most directives have a value.
